Message: Final Test! My name is Zedekiah Heteroza. I'm 17 years old. Our house is in the northeast section of Caranglaan, where all the sitios are, and I am an only child. I study as a first year BSIT student at Universidad de Dagupan. I don't smoke nor drink. I'm in bed by 10 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm water and doing about twenty minutes of contemplating before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I'm a person who dreams of having a successful future and a loving family. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Who am I? I am who I'm meant to be. Cogito, ergo sum; I think, therefore I am.
